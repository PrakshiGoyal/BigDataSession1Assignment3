which:
which returns the pathnames of the files (or links) which would be executed in the current environment, had the filename (or filenames) been given as a command (or commands) in a strictly POSIX-conformant shell. It does this by searching the paths in the PATH environment variable for executable files matching the names of the arguments.

syntax:
which -a [filename] ...

options:
-a	       Print all matching pathnames of each matching filename.

0	       All filenames were found, and all were executable.
1	       One or more filenames were not found, or were not executable.
2	       An invalid option was specified.
