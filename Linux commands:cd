cd:
The cd command, which stands for "change directory", changes the shell's current working directory.

syntax:
cd documents/work/accounting

options:
cd /       To change into the root directory, making it our working directory.
cd .       The current directory, regardless of which directory it is, is represented by a single dot (".").
           So, running this command would change us into the directory we're already in. In other words, it would do nothing, but it would do it successfully.
