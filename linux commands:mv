mv:
mv renames file SOURCE to DEST, or moves the SOURCE file (or files) to DIRECTORY.

syntax:
mv [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
mv [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
mv [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...

options:
--backup[=CONTROL]	  Make a backup of each existing destination file, using the control method CONTROL. (See Backup Methods below for more about control methods.)
-b	Like --backup,    but does not accept an argument; the default backup method is used.
-f, --force	          Do not prompt before overwriting existing files.
-i, --interactive	    Prompt before overwriting each existing destination file, regardless of the file's permissions. If the answer to the prompt is negative, the file is skipped.
-n, --no-clobber	    Do not overwrite any existing file.
